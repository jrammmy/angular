<h2>String Interpolation</h2>
<p>String interpolation allows you to display strings defined within component.ts</p>
<p>To do this the data must first be defined within compent.ts</p>
<p>Then, that data can be displayed in the html by encloing data between two sets of curly braces.</p>
<h3>Example:</h3>
<p>My name is {{ name }}</p>
<p>Here I have defined 'name' to be my name and enclosed that varable between two curly braces.</p>
