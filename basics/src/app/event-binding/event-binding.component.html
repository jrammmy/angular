<h2>Event Binding</h2>
<p>Event binding allows you to to listen to user events.</p>
<p>Angular lets you do this by adding a (click) attribute that can take in a function.</p>
<h3>Example:</h3>
<p>Here I have a 'name' varable that can be cleared using event binding</p>
<p>Hello my name is {{ name }}</p>
<button class="btn btn-primary" (click)="clear()">Clear</button>
<button class="btn btn-primary" (click)="undo()">Undo Clear</button>
